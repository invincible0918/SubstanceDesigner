# Substance Designer Practice

One of our projects wants a kind of stylized art direction. So I create some stylised "hand painted" tiles.
100% procedural, no bitmaps.

A few universally useful techniques in here, including how to create and use "shape splatter" node.

And how to create a tiles with overlap but no intersection, and uses for the curvature smooth node.
